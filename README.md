# Machine-Learning
Implementation of LVQ 2.1 in Python.

Made a function that takes as input the data (list of data vectors) and a list of corresponding
labels. The output/goal is to return labeled prototypes and predicted data class assignments. It was machine larning project for our Computational Intelligence course.
