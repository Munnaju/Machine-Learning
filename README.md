Implementation of LVQ 2.1 in Python.

Created thee LVQ algorithm from scratch that takes the data (list of data vectors) as input and a list of corresponding
labels. The output/goal is to return labeled prototypes and predicted data class assignments. It was machine larning project for our Computational Intelligence course.
